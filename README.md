## Flower Classification using CNN

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for a flower classification project using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The goal of this project is to classify different species of flowers from images. CNNs are a powerful tool for image classification tasks, making them well-suited for this project.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project can be found in the "data" directory. It includes a collection of flower images categorized into different classes. The dataset contains:

- Training images
- Validation images
- Test images

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.x installed
- Required libraries and packages (See `requirements.txt`)

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Start by cloning this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Luvi64bit/flower-classification.git
cd flower-classification
```

2. Organize your flower dataset into the "data" directory. Make sure to have separate folders for training, validation, and test datasets, each containing subfolders for different flower classes.

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Flower_prediction_Project.ipynb` to train and evaluate the CNN model.

4. You can also use the trained model for flower classification by calling the appropriate functions or endpoints, depending on your application.

## Model Training

The Jupyter Notebook `Flower_prediction_Project.ipynb` provides step-by-step instructions for:

- Data preprocessing (image resizing, data augmentation, etc.)
- Model architecture design
- Model training and evaluation
- Hyperparameter tuning (if necessary)

## Results

The project's success and performance metrics are detailed in the notebook. Make sure to review these metrics to assess the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
